1- The first kind of game i played are MMOs and there while playing as a kid i learned a lot of english.
2- I sometimes read novels like Overgeared because it makes me think that we in this world we are not that far from something like that happening.
3- I like to learn new stuff even though i may forget about it a few weeks later.
